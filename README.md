# Transients

Transients is a plugin for [Boilerplate](http://github.com/resknow/boilerplate) that makes managing and storing HTTP responses easier. It's based on the WordPress Transients API but with some differences.

At the moment, only GET is supported. Support for other methods will be added in the future.
